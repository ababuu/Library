# Library
This is a project I've done for the odin project course. What it does is it stores books the user inputs and marks them as 'read' or 'not read yet'. 
It stores the books added on local storage, which is displayed next time the user opens the page. 
Here is a [preview](https://ababuu.github.io/Library/index.html)
