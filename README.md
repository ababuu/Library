# Library
This is a project I've done for the odin project course. What it does is it stores books the user inputs and marks them as 'read' or 'not read yet'. 
I had some problems with the localStorage and might not work as expected when reloading the page cuz the object may not be stored in the object correctly. 
Here is a [preview](https://ababuu.github.io/Library/index.html)
